- Built dynamic and flexible navigation with nested routes.
- Used Outlet Context to share data between nested route children.
- Applied conditional rendering to manage dynamic UI content.
- Integrated an external API (TMDb) with asynchronous data fetching and state management.
- Created reusable components and passed data using props.
- Developed responsive designs using CSS Flexbox and media queries.
- Built a consistent layout structure across pages.
- Used dotenv to securely manage the API key.
