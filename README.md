# Cine-List 🎬

CineList is a user-friendly web application that allows users to discover and browse movies using data fetched from [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API. It features a responsive UI, search functionality, pagination, and detailed movie information.

Throughout this project, I focused on mastering essential React and frontend development concepts:

- Implemented dynamic URL structures and pagination using React Router.
- Built dynamic and flexible navigation with nested routes.
- Used Outlet Context to share data between nested route children.
- Applied conditional rendering to manage dynamic UI content.
- Integrated an external API (TMDb) with asynchronous data fetching and state management.
- Created reusable components and passed data using props.
- Developed responsive designs using CSS Flexbox and media queries.
- Built a consistent layout structure across pages.
- Used dotenv to securely manage the API key.
